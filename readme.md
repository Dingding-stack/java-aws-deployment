# Java Web Application Deployment on AWS

The `ROOT.war` package was provided as part of a DevOps training project. I was fully responsible for independently deploying, configuring, and troubleshooting the application on AWS.

---

## 🚀 Deployment Stack

- **Cloud**: AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 20.04)
- **App Server**: Apache Tomcat 9
- **Database**: MySQL 8
- **WAR File**: `ROOT.war` (given, not developed by me)
- The web app was successfully deployed and tested on two AWS EC2 instances (Node 1 and Node 2). For security reasons, public IP addresses are not included.

---

## 🧠 Skills Practiced

- SSH remote login and Ubuntu system management  
- MySQL root password reset and connection testing  
- Apache Tomcat installation and configuration  
- WAR deployment and resolving 404 errors  
- AWS EC2 security group setup for port 8080  
- Nginx installation and multi-instance deployment  
- System status display via custom alarm endpoint

## 📋 Deployment Steps

1. Launched EC2 Ubuntu instances (Node 1 and Node 2)  
2. Installed Java, MySQL, and Tomcat on Node 1  
3. Uploaded and deployed `ROOT.war` to `/webapps`  
4. Opened port 8080 in AWS security group  
5. Restarted Tomcat and verified service  
6. Installed and verified Nginx on Node 2 (port 80)  
7. Tested connectivity with translated web UI and alarm endpoint

✅ **3. EC2 Security Group Port Configuration**  
Port 8080 (TCP) was opened to `0.0.0.0/0` via AWS security group to allow external access.

✅ **6. Architecture Diagram**  
This diagram outlines the complete setup:
- EC2 instance with Apache Tomcat + MySQL  
- Deployed WAR application  
- Port 8080 open for HTTP access  
- Separate EC2 instance running Nginx  
- End-user accesses via browser
